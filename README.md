# "dotfiles" and system configuration

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wincent/wincent/media/screenshot.png)

* Target platforms: macOS and Red Hat-like Linuxes (eg. CentOS).
* Set-up method: ~~Beautiful and intricate snowflake~~ incredibly over-engineered [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) orchestration.
* Visible in the screenshot:
  * [Tomorrow Night](https://chriskempson.github.io/base16) color scheme.
  * Adobe Source Code Pro (Light) font.
  * Vim, running inside tmux, inside iTerm2, on macOS "El Capitan".

## Features

### Dotfiles

[A set of dotfiles](https://github.com/wincent/wincent/tree/master/roles/dotfiles/files) that I've been tweaking and twiddling since the early 2000s ([under version control](https://github.com/wincent/wincent/commit/61a7e2a830edb7) since 2009). Characteristics include:

* Sane Vim pasting via bracketed paste mode.
* Write access to local clipboard from local and remote hosts, inside and outside of tmux (via [Clipper](https://github.com/wincent/clipper)).
* Full mouse support (pane/split resizing, scrolling, text selection) in Vim and tmux.
* Focus/lost events for Vim inside tmux.
* Cursor shape toggles on entering Vim.
* Italics in the terminal.
* Bundles a (not-excessive) number of [useful Vim plug-ins](https://github.com/wincent/wincent/tree/master/roles/dotfiles/files/.vim/bundle).
* Conservative Vim configuration (very few overrides of core functionality; most changes are unobtrusive enhancements; some additional functionality exposed via `<Leader>` and `<LocalLeader>` mappings.
* Relatively restrained Zsh config, Bash-like but with a few Zsh perks, such as right-side prompt, auto-cd hooks, command elapsed time printing and such.
* Unified color-handling (across iTerm2 and Vim) via [Base16 Shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell).
* Encrypted versioning of files with sensitive content (via [git-cipher](https://github.com/wincent/git-cipher)).
* Comprehensive [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) [config](https://github.com/wincent/wincent/tree/master/roles/dotfiles/files/.hammerspoon).

### Homebrew

On macOS, [the `homebrew` role](https://github.com/wincent/wincent/tree/master/roles/homebrew) installs [a bunch of useful software](https://github.com/wincent/wincent/blob/master/roles/homebrew/files/Brewfile).

### Keyboard customization

On macOS, Hammerspoon is used to provide the functionality previously provided in [the `keyboard` role](https://github.com/wincent/wincent/tree/c250a81d235bef574d3a7cf2f2bb7a585bcd9686/roles/keyboard) via [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/):

* Make Caps Lock serve as Backspace (when tapped), repeated Backspace (when pressed and held), and Left Control (when chorded with another key).
* Make Return serve as Return (when tapped), repeated Return (when pressed and held), and Right Control (when chorded with another key).
* Maps Control-I to F6 in the terminal so that it can be mapped independently from Tab in Vim.

Other functionality that *used* to come via Karabiner isn't (yet) supported because Karabiner itself doesn't support macOS Sierra, and its successor, [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements), still has a pretty primitive feature set:

* Adds a "SpaceFN" layer that can be activated by holding down Space while hitting other keys; I use this to make the cursor keys available on or near the home row in any app.
* Turn Caps Lock on by tapping both Shift keys simultaneously (turn it off by tapping either Shift key on its own).
* Make the YubiKey work with the Colemak keyboard layout.
* Makes the function keys on my external Realforce keyboard behave like the "media" keys on Apple's keyboards. F13 serves as a sticky "fn" key, and F15 as Power.

## Dependencies

* [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) 2.3 or later.
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) 8.0 or later with Ruby and Python support (although there's a reasonable amount of feature detection in order to degrade gracefully).
* Relatively recent [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/).
* Relatively recent [Git](http://git-scm.com/).
* [Clipper](https://wincent.com/products/clipper) for transparent access to the local system clipboard.
* On macOS, [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/). Additionally, only the latest version of macOS (currently Sierra) gets actively tested.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) to perform setup via the included `install` command.

## Installation

### Clone

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/wincent/wincent.git
```

Note that if you're behind a firewall you may need to set up a temporary `~/.gitconfig` with appropriate proxy configuration with a format such as:

```
[http]
	proxy = fwdproxy:8080
```

### Install

```sh
./install        # installs everything on the local machine
./install --help # info on installing specific roles, force-installing etc
```

This sets up a local Python environment using the bundled virtualenv, bootstraps Ansible, and then uses Ansible to copy the dotfiles and configure the machine.

As a fallback strategy, in case the `install` script fails, you can symlink the dotfiles by hand with a command like the following:

```sh
for DOTFILE in $(find roles/dotfiles/files -maxdepth 1 -name '.*' | tail -n +2); do
  ln -sf $PWD/$DOTFILE ~
done
```

**Note:** The `ln -sf` command will overwrite existing files, but will fail to overwrite existing directories.
