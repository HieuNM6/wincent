# Changelog

## 2016-11-30

### Enhancement

* Fine-tuned Vim startup performance from 500ms down to 150ms.

## 2016-11-29

### Breaking

* Updated base16 dependencies, which means that the existing `dark`/`light` scheme names no longer apply. Instead of `dark tomorrow` (`color dark tomorrow`) or `light tomorrow` (`color light tomorrow`), run `color tomorrow-night` and `color tomorrow`. Note that some schemes [no longer have light variants](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16/issues/42) at all. `color` continues to show currently configured scheme information and `color help` shows a list of all available colors.

## 2016-11-22

### Breaking

* Replaced Karabiner configuration with custom Hammerspoon configuration, because Karabiner does not work on macOS Sierra.
  * Features that survived translation:

    * `<Tab>` and `<C-i>` can still be mapped independently in the terminal.
  * Features that have not yet been ported:
    * "SpaceFN" layer.
